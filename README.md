This library has no dependencies other than the Nim standard library.

## About

Simple benchmarking to time your code. Just put your code in a `timeIt` block. Also put result of your computation into `keep()` so that compiler does not optimize it out. Don't forgot to run with `-d:release` or better yet `-d:danger`.

```nim
import benchy, std/os, std/random

timeIt "sleep 1ms":
  sleep(1)

timeIt "sleep 200ms":
  sleep(200)

timeIt "sleep random":
  sleep(rand(0 .. 150))

timeIt "number counter":
  var s = 0
  for i in 0 .. 1_000_000:
    s += s
  keep(s)

timeIt "string append":
  var s = "?"
  for i in 0 .. 26:
    s.add(s)
  keep(s)
```

It will run the `timeIt` block at least 10 times but possibly more to figure out the standard deviation. It will keep running it until things look like they stabilized. It will stop after 60s though.
